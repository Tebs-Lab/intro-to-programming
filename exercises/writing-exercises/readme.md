# Solving Problems With Python

In all of the following exercises you'll be asked to complete a function that performs some task using Python. A couple simple tests are provided for each exercise but these tests are **not** exhaustive, and you'll be asked to expand the tests each time. Throughout the exercise, feel free to ask other students or the instructor for help!

For each of the exercises, follow these steps:

1. Read the problem description carefully.
2. Look at the provided tests, do they match your understanding of the problem?
3. Write at least 3 more tests.
4. Complete the function so that it correctly solves the problem
    * You will want to run the code **a lot** during this part.
5. When your code passes all the tests, ask yourself: "Can I break this?"
    * Add 2 more tests with the goal of finding a test that breaks your code.
    * If you succeed at breaking your code, fix the bug you just found!
6. In a professional setting, you'd likely repeat step 5 several more times. 
    * Feel free to repeat step 5 if you can think of more edge cases that might break your function.
    * But don't get stuck on this step for too long.
