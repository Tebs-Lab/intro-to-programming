# Code Reading Exercises

Reading code is just as important (if not more important) than writing code. It's also easier to write code after working through a few examples of existing code. Open each of the Python files in this directory and answer the questions in the comments. Throughout the exercise, feel free to ask other students or the instructor for help!  

For each file, follow these steps:

1. Read the code (do not execute the code yet!).
2. Try to describe what the function or functions do.
3. Try to describe how the function(s) acheive that behavior.
4. Predict the output (each example prints some stuff).
5. Run the code and check your predictions.
6. If you were wrong, try to figure out why.
