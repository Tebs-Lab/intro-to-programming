# We often have values that should be grouped.
# Python offers two main "collections" for such cases:
# the list and the dictionary.

# Lists are an ordered collection of items.
# We can make a new one using square brackets: []
empty_list = []
l_one = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
l_two = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']

# We choose the order, so this is perfectly allowed:
l_three = [6, 1, 2 , 5, 4, 3]

# We can fetch a particular item from the list using "bracket notation"
# Programmers pronounce this line of code "print l_one sub zero" and it
# returns the item in the first position of the list, which is the number 1.
print(l_one[0])

# So what does this print?
print(l_two[3])

# What about this?
print(l_three[-1])

# looping over lists is easy in Python with the "for loop"
print("\nFor l_one: ")
for i in l_one:
    print(i)

print("\nFor l_two: ")
for i in l_two:
    print(i)

print("\nFor l_three: ")
for i in l_three:
    print(i)

# Sometimes it is useful to have the index value
# as well as the value from the list. In Python we 
# can use the enumerate function for this:
print("\nenumerate")
for index, value in enumerate(l_two):
    print(index, value)

# Lists have many useful functions built in that we can use, such as 
# append for adding an item to the end of a list, and the len function
# for determining how many items are in a list. See the docs for more:
# https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html

new_list = []
new_list.append('hello')
new_list.append('good')
new_list.append('people')

print("\n", new_list, len(new_list))
